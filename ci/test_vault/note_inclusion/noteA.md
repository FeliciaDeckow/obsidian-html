# noteA
## Test of this page
This page has a link to noteC, which is in a different folder, and different folderdepth relative to the root, than this note.

This page also has an inclusion of noteB, which is in a different folder, and different folderdepth relative to the root, than this note, and noteC.

noteB has a link to noteC. 

This results in two links on this page, which both need to point to the same location.

Both notes also include a small picture, the same reasoning follows for that.
